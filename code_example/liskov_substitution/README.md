# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

## Overview

Welcome to the code examples section for the Liskov Substitution Principle, a crucial part of the SOLID design principles. The Liskov Substitution Principle asserts that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the application's correctness. This principle promotes the use of inheritance in a way that no derived class should override the non-overridable methods of the base class.

## Objective

The examples in this directory aim to demonstrate the application of the Liskov Substitution Principle in a language-agnostic manner. Through these examples, we explore how adhering to LSP can lead to more robust and maintainable software architectures.

## Examples Description

`example1`: A basic example that demonstrates the concept of LSP. It shows a superclass and subclass, highlighting how the subclass can be used in place of the superclass.  
`example2`: This example delves into a more complex scenario, illustrating common pitfalls that violate LSP and how to rectify them.  
`real_world_example`: Provides a real-world scenario where applying LSP is crucial, showing its practical benefits in software design.  

## How to Run the Examples

(Provide general instructions on how to execute or review the examples, considering that they might be written in different programming languages. Mention any common tools or environments that might be needed.)

```bash
// Example pseudo-command to run or review an example
run example1
```

## Key Takeaways

- Gaining a clear understanding of the Liskov Substitution Principle and its importance in object-oriented design.
- Learning to identify and avoid violations of LSP in code design.
- Acquiring practical skills for implementing LSP in diverse programming environments to enhance software modularity and reliability.
