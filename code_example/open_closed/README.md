# Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

## Overview

This directory showcases code examples that illustrate the Open/Closed Principle, an essential component of the SOLID principles in software engineering. The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (like classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code.

## Objective

The purpose of these examples is to demonstrate the application of the Open/Closed Principle in a way that's independent of any specific programming language. By doing so, we aim to provide insights into creating more scalable and maintainable software designs.

## Examples Description

`example1`: Shows a basic implementation of the Open/Closed Principle. It provides a scenario where new functionality is added without changing existing code.  
`example2`: This example demonstrates a more advanced application of OCP, focusing on extending the functionalities of a module using patterns like inheritance or composition.  
`real_world_example`: Provides a real-world case study that applies OCP, illustrating the practical benefits and enhancements in software design.  

## How to Run the Examples

(Provide general instructions on how to execute or review the examples, considering that they might be written in different programming languages. Mention any common tools or environments that might be needed.)

```bash
// Example pseudo-command to run or review an example
run example1
```

## Key Takeaways

- Understanding the core concept of being "open for extension, but closed for modification."
- Learning how to design modules or classes that don't require modification when adding new features.
- Gaining insights into practical implementation strategies for adhering to the Open/Closed Principle in various programming environments.
