# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

## Overview

This directory contains examples demonstrating the Interface Segregation Principle, an integral aspect of the SOLID design principles. The Interface Segregation Principle advocates that no client should be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. This principle guides the creation of fine-grained interfaces that are client-specific rather than one large, general-purpose interface.

## Objective

The aim of these examples is to illustrate the application of the Interface Segregation Principle in a language-agnostic way. They are designed to show how segregating interfaces can lead to more decoupled and easier-to-manage code structures.

## Examples Description

`example1`: An introductory example showing the implementation of ISP. It contrasts a monolithic interface with segregated, specific interfaces.
`example2`: This example explores a more advanced implementation, demonstrating the benefits of ISP in a scenario with multiple clients requiring different functionalities.
`real_world_example`: A real-world case study highlighting the practical application and advantages of ISP in software design.

## How to Run the Examples

(Provide general instructions on how to execute or review the examples, considering that they might be written in different programming languages. Mention any common tools or environments that might be needed.)

```bash
// Example pseudo-command to run or review an example
run example1
```

## Key Takeaways

- Understanding the concept of interface segregation and its role in creating flexible, modular software.
- Learning how to design client-specific interfaces to prevent the overload of single interfaces with unnecessary methods.
- Gaining insights into applying ISP effectively in various programming environments for better software architecture.
