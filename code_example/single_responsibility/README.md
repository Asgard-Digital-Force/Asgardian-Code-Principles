# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## Overview

This directory contains code examples illustrating the Single Responsibility Principle, one of the key aspects of SOLID principles in software development. The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.

## Objective

The aim of these examples is to showcase how implementing SRP can lead to more maintainable, flexible, and understandable code. We demonstrate how splitting functionalities into distinct classes or functions can enhance the modularity and readability of your code.

## Examples Description

`example1`: This file demonstrates a basic implementation of SRP. It shows a common coding scenario refactored to adhere to SRP, highlighting the before and after differences.
`example2`: In this example, we take a more complex scenario where a class is initially handling multiple responsibilities and break it down into smaller, more focused classes.
`real_world_example`: This example is a real-world situation where applying SRP can significantly improve the design and maintainability of the code.

## How to Run the Examples

(Provide instructions on how to execute or test the examples. This might include command line instructions, necessary environment setup, or any dependencies required.)

```bash
// Example command to run an example
run example1
```

## Key Takeaways

- Understanding the importance of single responsibility in classes or functions.
- Recognizing common signs in your code that SRP is being violated.
- Practical insight into refactoring existing code to align with SRP.
